This is an experimental implementation of the Warren Abstract Machine
(WAM), which is used to execute Prolog programs. This was developed as
I was reading through the [tutorial by Hassan AÃ¯t-Kaci][book]. I have
vague plans to develop it further into a full-fledged Prolog
interpreter, but it's going to be a slow process. =)
